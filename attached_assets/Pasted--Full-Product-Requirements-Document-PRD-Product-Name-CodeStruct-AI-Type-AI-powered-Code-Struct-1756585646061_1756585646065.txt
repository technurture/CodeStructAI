üìÑ Full Product Requirements Document (PRD)
Product Name: CodeStruct AI
Type: AI-powered Code Structuring & Commenting Extension
Target Platforms: Visual Studio Code (initial), JetBrains IDEs, Sublime Text (future).

1. Objective
CodeStruct AI is an AI-driven coding assistant that analyzes, restructures, cleans, and comments codebases across multiple programming languages.

It enables:

Consistent architecture: Detects or enforces best practices.

Multi-language support: Python, JavaScript/TypeScript, Java, C#, Go, PHP, C/C++, Rust (initial set).

Automated documentation: Adds docstrings, inline comments, and file/module summaries.

Project scalability: Helps developers maintain clean, understandable codebases.

Seamless integration: Available inside VS Code and other editors.

Business model: 1-month free trial ‚Üí subscription plan (unlimited usage).

2. Key Features
üîç Codebase Analysis
Detect primary language(s) and frameworks.

Identify existing architecture (MVC, layered, modular, monolithic).

Spot inconsistencies, duplicate code, and dead code.

üß† AI-Powered Structuring
Learn from existing project patterns.

Suggest or apply restructuring (file/folder hierarchy).

Recommend missing layers (e.g., services, controllers, models).

Generate architecture if none exists (based on best practices per language).

‚ú® Code Cleaning & Refactoring
Format using language-specific standards (Prettier, ESLint, Black, ClangFormat, etc.).

Remove unused imports, dead variables, console logs, TODOs.

Improve function decomposition & naming consistency.

üí¨ Smart Commenting & Documentation
Auto-generate docstrings for functions/classes.

Add inline comments for complex logic.

Provide file/module summaries for quick understanding.

Generate README.md or project-level documentation if missing.

üõ† Developer Interaction
Sidebar Panel (VS Code):

Scan Project

Suggest Structure

Apply Fixes (with Git diff preview)

Inline AI Actions: Right-click ‚Üí ‚ÄúExplain code‚Äù / ‚ÄúRefactor code‚Äù.

Git Integration: Pre-commit AI check for structure/format.

üí≥ Subscription & Monetization
Free Trial: 1 month, limited to projects under 100 files.

Paid Plan (Unlimited):

Unlimited project scans & restructures.

Priority AI inference (faster responses).

Multi-language support unlocked.

Cloud-based AI model updates.

Payment via Stripe/AWS Marketplace integration.

3. User Stories
As a student, I want auto-generated comments so I can learn from my code.

As a developer, I want my project auto-structured and formatted so I can focus on logic.

As a team lead, I want to enforce consistent architecture across my team‚Äôs codebase.

As a freelancer, I want to restructure messy client projects quickly.

As a CTO, I want my engineers to follow standard architecture for scalability.

4. Technical Requirements
üñ• Client-Side (VS Code Extension)
Tech: TypeScript + VS Code Extension API.

Responsibilities:

Parse project tree.

Detect language(s) via file extensions & config files.

Send code chunks to backend AI.

Display AI suggestions (diff view, comments, restructuring proposals).

‚òÅÔ∏è Backend (AWS-based AI Integration)
Hosting: AWS Lambda + API Gateway (scalable, serverless).

AI Models:

AWS Bedrock (Anthropic Claude / Amazon Titan for structuring & doc generation).

Optionally OpenAI API fallback.

Data Processing:

Chunk large files for LLM.

Maintain project context (vector database: Amazon OpenSearch or Pinecone).

Database: Amazon RDS / DynamoDB for:

User accounts.

Subscription plans & billing status.

Project history & preferences.

Auth: AWS Cognito (OAuth, JWT).

Payment: Stripe or AWS Marketplace subscription model.

üîê Security & Privacy
Code processing is local-first; only anonymized or user-approved snippets sent to backend.

End-to-end encrypted communication.

Enterprise tier: self-hosted AI backend in customer‚Äôs AWS account.

5. Non-Functional Requirements
Performance: Handle projects <200 files in under 30s.

Scalability: Auto-scale AWS Lambda for large usage.

Reliability: 99.9% uptime SLA for paid plans.

Usability: Non-intrusive UI (suggests, doesn‚Äôt overwrite without approval).

Extensibility: Support new languages via plugin modules.

6. Success Metrics
Developer Adoption: ‚â• 10K downloads in first 6 months.

Retention: ‚â• 50% of free trial users convert to paid.

Impact: Reduction of 30% in code review comments on structure/format.

Engagement: Avg. 5+ project scans per week per active user.
